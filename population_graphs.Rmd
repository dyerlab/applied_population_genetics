# Population Graphs {.imageChapter}

<div class="chapter_image"><img src="chapter_images/ch_euphorbia.jpg"></div>

Population Graphs are a statistical representation of among population genetic variance, $\sigma^2_A$, as viewed through a network (Dyer & Nason 2004).  A population graph is a graph-theoretic interpretation of genetic covariance and serves as a tool for understanding underlying evolutionary history for a set of populations.  

These structures are estimated in R using the **popgraphs** library.  

```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(popgraph)
```

As other networks, a population graph is a graph-theoretic structure that can be represetendHere we will focus on the former approach as it is native to this package.  If you use the latter one, it will produce a *.pgraph file and you can read it in using the `read_popgraph()` function.


## Adding data to a graph

A population graph is made more informative if you can associate some data with topology.  External data may be spatial or ecolgoical data associated with each node.  Edge data may be a bit more complicated as it is traversing both spatial and ecolgoical gradients and below we'll see how to extract particular from rasters using edge crossings. 

Included in the *popgraph* package are some build-in data sets to illustrate some of the utility. Included is the cactus topology that was originally used to develop this approach (from Dyer & Nason 2004).

```{r}
data(lopho)
class(lopho)
lopho
```

We can associate data with the nodes using the `decorate_graph()` function.  This takes a `data.frame` object and tries to match up the columns of data in the data.frame to the nodes.  Here is an example with some addition built-in data.  The option `stratum` indicates the name of the column that has the node labels in it (which are stored as `V(graph)$name`).

```{r}
data(baja)
summary(baja)
lopho <- decorate_graph( lopho, baja, stratum="Population")
lopho
```

Each vertex now has seveal different types of data associated with it now.  We will use this below.









### Plotting a graph using **ggplot2** routines

The **ggplot2** package provides a spectacular plotting environment in an intuitive context and there are now some functions to support the Population Graphs in this context.  

If you haven't used **ggplot2** before, it may at first be a bit odd because it deviates from normal plotting  approaches where you just shove a bunch of arguments into a single plotting function.  In **ggplot**, you build a graphic in the same way you build a regression equation.  A regression equation has an intercept and potentially a bunch of independent terms.  This is exactly how **ggplot** builds plots, by adding togther components.

To specifiy how things look in a plot, you need to specify an aesthetic using the `aes()` funciton.  Here is where you supply the variable names you use for coordinate, coloring, shape, etc.  For both of the `geom_*set` funcitons, these names **must** be attributes of either the node or edge sets in the graph itself.

Here is an example using the *Lopohcereus* graph.  We begin by making a `ggplot()` object and then adding to it a `geom_` object.  The 5**popgraph** package comes with two funcitons, one for edges and one for nodes.  

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot() 
p <- p + geom_edgeset( aes(x=Longitude,y=Latitude), lopho ) 
p
```

I broke up the plotting into several lines to improve readability, it is not necessary to to this in practice though.  The addition of additional `geom_` objects to the plot will layer them on top (n.b., I also passed the *size=4* option to the plot as the default point size is a bit too small and this is how you could change that).

```{r}
p <- p +  geom_nodeset( aes(x=Longitude, y=Latitude), lopho, size=4)
p
```

And then you can add additional options to the plot, like axis labels and a less exciting background theme (the `theme_empty()` provided by **popgraph** is actually transparent so you can save the image and throw it into a presentation as necessary).


```{r}
p <- ggplot() + geom_edgeset( aes(x=Longitude,y=Latitude), lopho, color="darkgrey" )
p <- p + geom_nodeset( aes(x=Longitude, y=Latitude, color=Region, size=size), lopho) 
p <- p + xlab("Longitude") + ylab("Latitude") 
p + theme_empty()
```

You can also use the default layout routines in *igraph* for visualization.  Here is an example using Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(igraph)
c <- layout.fruchterman.reingold( lopho )
V(lopho)$x <- c[,1]
V(lopho)$y <- c[,2]
p <- ggplot() + geom_edgeset( aes(x,y), lopho, color="darkgrey" )
p <- p + geom_nodeset( aes(x, y, color=Region, size=size), lopho) 
p + theme_empty()
```



### Reading Existing **popgraph** Files


The online versions of Population Graphs provides a *.pgraph file for visualization. These files are visualized in several different software platforms including GeneticStudio (Dyer 2009), a OpenGL visualization application (Dyer &amp; Nason 2004), an online visualization framework at http://dyerlab.bio.vcu.edu, and of course, in R.  We shall focus on this last one.  Reading in files to R 

```{r,eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
graph <- read.popgraph( "thegraph.pgraph" )
```


### Saving Population Graph Objects


A **popgraph** object is a normal R object and can be saved using the normal R mechanisms.

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
save( lopho, file="MyLophoGraph.rda")
```


For interoperability, **popgraph** objects can also be saved in other formats. These are accessed through the `write.popgraph()` function.  

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
write.popgraph(lopho,file="~/Desktop/Cactus.pgraph", format="pgraph")
```
There are several other options available for outputing your graph.  Currently the other formats that have been implemented are:

1. `json` A format for html javascript data processing.  
+ `kml` The Keyhole Markup Language which is read by GoogleEarth.  This requires `Latitude` and `Longtitude` vertex properties.
+ `graphml` The graph markup language.
+ `html` Export as an interactive html document you can manipulate on your desktop (uses javascript d3.js library so you need an internet connection).
+ `pajek` Export to a format that works with the software Pajek (http://pajek.imfm.si/doku.php?id=pajek)
+ `pgraph` The format used in GeneticStudio and the original popgraph 3D viewer (this is the default).
+ `adjacency` Saves the adjacency matrix of the graph (binary) as a CSV file
+ `paths` Saves the shortest paths matrix as a CSV file
+ `weights` Saves the adjacency matrix with edge weights.



## Interactive Networks

To create a popgraph, you need to pass the `popgraph()` function genotypes as multivariate variables—the function `to_mv()` does this behind the scene—and a vector of variables that allocate each row of data to a node.  Here we use the 'Population' vector from the arapat `data.frame`.

```{r interactive1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(gstudio)
library(popgraph)
data(arapat)
graph <- popgraph(to_mv(arapat),groups = arapat$Population)
print(graph)
```

The `forceNetwork()` function is what does the plotting and it needs some data that are in a specific format.  Essentially, there needs to be two `data.frame` objects with the following attributes:  

 - **nodes** - A `data.frame` with each row representing the name of the node to be displayed, the group the node belongs to (if there are groupings of nodes to be displayed by alternative colors), and a vector of node sizes.  
 - **edges** - A `data.frame` representing the edge connecting the nodes, labeled as 'from' and 'to' and a vector of weights.  
 
The 'from' and 'to' vectors need to be numeric values of the nodes in the other data frame **and** need to be 0-indexed (e.g., the first node name it is going to look up is indexed as '0' in the javascript instead of '1' as is common in R).  



```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nodes <- to_data.frame( graph, mode="nodes", as.named=FALSE )
edges <- to_data.frame( graph, mode="edges", as.named=FALSE )
edges$source <- edges$source - 1
edges$target <- edges$target - 1 
```

The only last thing to do is to define a grouping of populations.  This will be represented in the network as a coloring.  For this one, I'm going to use the hypothesized STRUCTURE clustering (see \@ref(admixture) for how this was done).  In the `arapat` data set, there is a designation for each individual on which cluster they belong.  Some populations are 'pure' in their groupings but others (in spatial regions of sympatry) they are mixed.  Below I determine the estimated STRUCTURE groups for each population and collapse those who have more than one into a single string.


```{r}
grps <- by( arapat$Cluster, arapat$Population, unique )
l <- lapply( grps, function(x) { g <- paste(sort(x),collapse="/") })
df <- data.frame( name=names(l), group=as.character(l))
nodes <- merge( nodes, df )
```



Once defined, we can then call the function to make the `data.frame` objects and then do the plot.  These graphics are *interactive*, grab a node and drag it around!

```{r}
library(networkD3)
forceNetwork(Links = edges, Nodes = nodes,
            Source = "source", Target = "target",
            Value = "value", NodeID = "name",
            Group = "group", opacity=1.0,
            legend=TRUE, fontSize = 16,
            zoom=TRUE )
```




## Spatial Population Graphs


Mapping the nodes and edges onto real space is a key task in the understanding of how covariance is partitioned on the landscape.  There are several approaches that can be used in R since it is such a flexible platform.  In what follows I will use a series of techniques that I find useful ordered from the simplest to the more complicated.  



### Integrating Google and **ggplot2** for Plotting

R has some pretty good facilities for using spatial assests from Google and OpenStreetMaps and is a very easy way to get quick plots from Population Graphs, particularly if you can integrate it into the **ggplot2** framework.

Using the **ggmap** package, you can request map tiles and use as backgrounds onto which you can plot specific objects.  To do so, you must first get:

- Either the centroid of the location you are interested in finding and a value of zoom (just like in google maps), or
- A bounding box with left, bottom, right, top coordinates.  This is a bit of an experimental thing and does not always get you what you want.  

Some fiddling is required with either way you go.  The map you get from `get_map()` is essentially a huge matrix of hex colors as shown above.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ggmap)
location <- c( mean(V(lopho)$Longitude), mean(V(lopho)$Latitude))
location
map <- get_map(location,maptype="satellite", zoom=6)
dim(map)
map[1:4,1:4]
```

This map object can be passed on to `ggmap()`, which replaces the traditional `ggplot()` funciton and sets up the bounding box in terms of Latitude and Longtidue.  Onto this, you can plot the graph topologoy using:

- `geom_edgeset()` This takes the graph and plots out the edges.  
- `geom_nodeset()` This plots out the nodes.  You could probably use a regular *data.frame* and `geom_point()` as well. Here is an example:

```{r}
p <- ggmap( map ) 
p <- p + geom_edgeset( aes(x=Longitude,y=Latitude), lopho, color="white" ) 
p <- p + geom_nodeset( aes(x=Longitude, y=Latitude, color=Region, size=size), lopho) 
p + xlab("Longitude") + ylab("Latitude")
```



### Integrating Raster Maps

At times we have raster data upon we can plot a population graph. Here is an example from Baja California. The underlying raster image is croped from a WorldClim tile and represents elevation.  

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(raster)
data(alt)
plot(alt)
```

Since it is a **raster** object, it knows how to plot itself relatively well.  There are a ton of good references for showing you how to play with raster data (e.g., Bivand *et al.* 2008)

To plot our graph onto this topology, we export the spatial components of the graph into objects that interact with rasters.  The packages provides simple extraction of features into `SpatialLines` and `SpatialPoints` objects.

```{r}
lopho.nodes <- to_SpatialPoints(lopho)
lopho.nodes
lopho.edges <- to_SpatialLines(lopho)
head(lopho.edges)
```

Once we have them extracted into the right format, we can add them to the raster plot.  I plot the nodes twice to overlay a circular icon (`pch=16`) onto the default cross marker and make them 50 \% larger (`cex=1.5`).

```{r, fig.width=8}
plot( alt )
plot( lopho.edges, add=TRUE, col="#555555" )
plot( lopho.nodes, add=TRUE, col="black", cex=1.5 )
plot( lopho.nodes, add=TRUE, col=V(lopho)$color, pch=16, cex=1.5 )
```


## Extracting Spatial Data Using Population Graphs


Since we are dealing with the spatial stuff right now, it makes sense to look into how we can use the topological features of the graph to extract spatial data.  


### Node Specific Data

The node data `nodes` is a `SpatialPoints` object and can be used to pull data from raster sources.  I'll start by creating a `data.frame` with some existing data in it.

```{r}
df.nodes <- data.frame(Pop=V(lopho)$name, Latitude=V(lopho)$Latitude, Longitude=V(lopho)$Longitude)
```


Then we can extract the elevation from the `alt` raster as:

```{r}
library(raster)
df.nodes$Elevation <- extract( alt, lopho.nodes )
summary(df.nodes)
```

Additional data could be extracted from other rasters.  See http://worldclim.org for some example data that may prove useful.


### Data Along Edges


```{r}
df.edge <- data.frame(Weight=E(lopho)$weight )
summary(df.edge)
```


For each of the `{r}length(E(lopho))` edges, we can exract the elevation profile.  Here is an example from one of the edges.

```{r}
plot(alt)
plot(lopho.edges[3],add=TRUE,col="red",lwd=3)
```

Along this transect, you can pull out the elevation values as follows (n.b., the return object is a list so I'm only taking the first, and only, element in it).

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
Elevation <- extract( alt, lopho.edges[3] )[[1]]
e <- extent( lopho.edges[3] )
e
Latitude <- seq(ymin(e),ymax(e),length.out=length(Elevation))
qplot( Latitude, Elevation, geom="line" )
```

There is a lot of ways that you can play with this functionality.  This should get you going.




## Extracting Graph-Theoretic Parameters


The underlying structure of a **popgraph** object is based upon the **igraph** package from Gabor Csardi.  A population graph is essentially a specific kind of **igraph**object and can be decorated with metadata that is useful for spatial population genetic analyses.  As such, there is a wealth of existing analyses from both the **igraph** as well as the **sna** packages that can be used on **popgraph** objects.  Here are some examples.

### Matrix Representations of Population Graph Objects

A graph topology is a graphical representation of a matrix and there are several reasons why you may want to use these matrices.  The function `to_matrix()` is an easy front-end to several kinds of matrices.  Matrix structure itself can be defined by adjacency matrics, either binary (the default) or weighed by the edge weight.  Several graph-theoretic parameters are derived from the adjacency matrix.  Here is an example from our little graph that started this document.

```{r}
to_matrix( lopho, mode="adjacency")[1:5,1:5]
to_matrix( lopho, mode="edge weight")[1:5,1:5]
```

In addition to who each node is connected to, it is often of interest to know the length of the shortest path through the matrix connecting nodes.  Here is a slightly larger example, using the cactus data so we can look at isolation by graph distance.

```{r}
cGD <- to_matrix( lopho, mode="shortest path")
cGD[1:5,1:5]
```

It should be noted that the shortest distance through a population graph is defined as the parameter $cGD$, conditional graph distance (see Dyer *et al.* 2010 for more information on this parameter).

Now, we need the physical distance between the nodes.  If the physical size of the sampling area is small we could just use the Pythagorean equation.  However, here the distance is relatively large and the curvature of the earth may be of interest to take into account.  There are seveal functions that will calculate 'great circle distance' but the easiest is `rdist.earth()` from the **fields** funtion.  


```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(gstudio)
df <- data.frame( Stratum = V(lopho)$name, 
                  Longitude  =V(lopho)$Longitude, 
                  Latitude = V(lopho)$Latitude ) 
pDist <- strata_distance( df )
```

Now, we can plot these values against each other to see if there is a pattern of 'isolation by distance' captured in the graph topology.  To do this, I extract only the upper triangle (e.g., the values above the diagonal of each matrix) because they are symmetric matrices and we do not want to look at each datum twice.

```{r}
df <- data.frame( cGD=cGD[upper.tri(cGD)], Phys=pDist[upper.tri(pDist)])
cor.test( df$Phys, df$cGD, method="spearman")
```

We can plot these values and make a trendline pretty easily.  Here is a plot using **ggplot2** (a very nice plotting library; you could use `plot()` to do the normal plotting but I think **ggplot2** does such a nice job I encourage its use).  

```{r,message=FALSE}
qplot( Phys, cGD, geom="point", data=df) + stat_smooth(method="loess") + xlab("Physical Distance") + ylab("Conditional Genetic Distance")
```

The trendline is the loess predicted line with confidence interval.  


### Node Specific Parameters

Features of the topology can be extracted as either properties of the nodes or the edges. Node properties may provide insights into localized processes (e.g., a 'sink' population).  There are a lot of different parameters that can be derived and several packages in R that help out.  Here are some basic ones.

```{r}
df.nodes$closeness <- closeness(lopho)
df.nodes$betweenness <- betweenness(lopho)
df.nodes$degree <- degree( lopho )
df.nodes$eigenCent <- evcent( lopho )$vector
df.nodes$Region <- factor(V(lopho)$Region)
summary(df.nodes,color="Region")
```


The relationship betwwen the node variables can be evaluated in a pair plot.

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,fig.width=8}
library(GGally)
ggpairs(df.nodes,columns=2:9, color='Region')
```




### Edge Specific Parameters


Edges may have specific properties as well.  Here are some examples using betweeness centrality, community, and regionality (if the edge connects within Baja or Sonora or crosses the Sea of Cortéz).

```{r}
df.edge$betweenness <- edge.betweenness(lopho)
df.edge$Region <- rep("Baja",52)
df.edge$Region[36:52] <- "Sonora"
df.edge$Region[c(11,24,27,35)] <- "Cortez"
ggpairs(df.edge, color="Region")
```




## Testing for Topological Congruence

If you have more than one topology and the node sets overlap sufficiently, you can test for the topological congruence of the two.  There are several specific reasons why population graph topologies may be congruent.  In this section we use the spatial genetic structure of the Senita cactus (*Lophocereus schottii*) and its obligate pollinator, *Upiga virescens* as an example.  This is an obligate pollination mutualism and as such we should expect there to be some degree of spatial genetic congruence between the species due to this co-evolution.  


```{r}
data(upiga)
upiga <- decorate_graph(upiga,baja,stratum="Population")
upiga.nodes <- to_SpatialPoints(upiga)
upiga.edges <- to_SpatialLines(upiga)
```

These two data sets were 'mostly' collected in the same physical locations.  Here is a comparison of the two topologies.

```{r,fig.width=9}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(lopho)
plot(upiga)
```

You can clearly see some differences in both the node and edge sets.  However, given the relationship between these organisms, there is an expectation that they should share some spatial structure.  The function `congruence_topology()` is designed to extract the congruence graph that is the intersection of both node and edge sets.  If the node sets are not completely overlapping (in this case they are not), it will give you a warning.  If you want to compare topologies, you must start with identical node sets because the topology in a Population Graph is based upon the entire structure, not just pairwise differences.  See the writeup about the **gstudio** package for more information on this.  

```{r,message=FALSE}
cong <- congruence_topology(lopho,upiga)
plot(cong)
```

We can then take the congruence graph and plot it or work with it in the normal fashion.

```{r}
cong <- decorate_graph( cong, baja )
cong.nodes <- to_SpatialPoints(cong)
cong.edges <- to_SpatialLines(cong)
plot(alt)
plot(cong.edges,add=T)
plot(cong.nodes,add=T, pch=16, col="red")
```


There are several ways to examine 'congruence' in graph topologies, of which I show two.  The first method is based upon the correlation of pair-wise distance through the graph for each.  That is to say, are proximate nodes in `lopho` similarily close in `upiga`?   This is called "Distance Congruence" and is based upon a non-parametric correlation of path distances.

```{r,warning=FALSE}
test_congruence(lopho,upiga,method="distance")
```

Another way is to ask about the pattern of connectivity. Based upon the number of nodes and edges in `lopho` and `upiga`, are there more in the congruence graph than could be expected if the two graph were just randomly associated?  This is called "Structural Congruence" and is determined combinatorially.  What is returned by this is the probability having as many edges as observed in the congruence graph given the size of the edge sets in the predictor graphs. You can think of this as the fraction of the area under the line as large or larger than the observed.

```{r,warning=FALSE}
test_congruence(lopho,upiga, method="combinatorial")
```


Hope this provides enough of an overview of the **popgraph** package to get you started.  If you have any questions feel free to email [mailto://rjdyer@vcu.edu].
